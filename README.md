# Machine-Learning-CNN-algo

Some code for machine leaning with use of tensorflow and keras.
Optimizer algorithm Adam is used and loss function is sparse_categorical_crossentropy
Sequential function is uses.

helloworldmi.py - contains the code for training the computer and acquirement of data, epochs 
image_show.py - converts the training and testing data set as images
sequential_function.py - contains functions definitions (normalization/scaling)
test_predictions.py - puts the algorithm to the test (check if algorithm is correct using the images)
